## 🩺 Project 1: Global Health Insights (Gapminder Health Data)

### 🔍 Project Overview

In this project, I worked as a **data analyst for a global health organisation**, analysing the **Gapminder Health dataset** to identify key health trends, disparities, and long-term changes in life expectancy across countries and continents.

The goal was to create clear, interactive visualisations that help stakeholders quickly understand **global health patterns** and support evidence-based decision-making.

---

### 🎯 Objectives

* Compare **life expectancy across continents**
* Analyse **life expectancy trends over time** for top-performing countries
* Visualise **population distribution by gender**
* Explore relationships between **life expectancy and BMI**
* Build an **interactive Tableau dashboard**

---

### 🛠️ Tools Used

* **Tableau Public**
* GapminderHealth.xlsx dataset
* Filters, calculated fields, and interactive dashboards

---

### 📈 Visualisations Created

1. **Life Expectancy by Continent**
   Bar chart showing average life expectancy by continent for the most recent year.

2. **Life Expectancy Trend (Top 5 Countries)**
   Line chart highlighting long-term life expectancy improvements in the top 5 countries.

3. **Population by Gender**
   Pie chart displaying population distribution by gender with an interactive country filter.

4. **Life Expectancy vs BMI**
   Scatter plot analysing the relationship between average BMI and life expectancy, coloured by continent.

5. **Additional Visualisation**
   An extra chart exploring health-related metrics to enhance insight.

### 📊 Dashboard

All visualisations were combined into a single interactive dashboard titled:

**🖥️ Global Health Dashboard**

### 🔎 Key Insights

* Significant differences in life expectancy exist between continents
* Top-performing countries show consistent long-term improvements
* Higher BMI is visibly associated with lower life expectancy in many regions
* Demographic and lifestyle factors strongly influence population health outcomes

### 🏥 NHS Relevance

The NHS could use these global insights as **benchmark data**, learning from best-performing health systems to inform:

* Preventative health strategies
* Lifestyle and obesity interventions
* Long-term public health planning

## 🎵 Project 2: Spotify Music Features Analysis

### 🔍 Project Overview

This project explores trends in **Spotify music features** using a large dataset of tracks and audio characteristics. The aim was to identify **patterns in popularity, energy, danceability, tempo, and musical attributes** to support future creative and commercial decisions.

---

### 🛠️ Tools Used

* **Tableau Public**
* CSV dataset: [Uploading SpotifyFeatures.xlsx…]()
* Interactive charts and dashboards

---

### 📈 Key Findings

* **Kimbo Children’s Music** leads among top artists in both **danceability and energy**
* **Tempo** varies significantly across musical keys, with keys such as **C and D** showing particularly high values
* **Instrumentalness** is slightly higher in **major mode** than minor, suggesting a preference for upbeat instrumental tracks
* Spotify track **popularity has steadily increased from 2003 to 2023**, reaching nearly **10 million** in recent years

---

### 📊 Dashboard

The analysis was presented in an interactive Tableau dashboard.
